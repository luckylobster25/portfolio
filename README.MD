This is a portfolio about me. I am creating everything from nothing. 
First of all, set up all the neccessary file such as reset.css, index.html, style.css and this README file. 
HTML file
    1. Setting everything that is default and work from there. In the head tag of the HTML I linked all my other file and make sure they all work properly. 
    2. Moving onto the body, create the Header, Main and Footer. These are the three big container. 
    3. Try to use other tag element other than the DIV. 
    4. Using class attribute and id attribute to help link to css later. Avoid using CSS directly on HTML sheet. Double check for duplicate Id attribute that is not wanted. 
    5. Attach photo by using img tag. 
    6. Use a tag for hyperlink and attachment such as Linkedin, Github, and resume. 

CSS file
    1. Reset.css is a css file that will make it look the same no matter which browser the user use. Everything is reset and start from there. 
    2. The style of the web page is style by using the css file. By using id and class tag along with the default tag, it is easy to target what we want to change or decorate. 
    3. One of the important thing to do in CSS is the Media@ which will change display depending on the screen size the user is using. 
    4. Code are adjust accordly to the screen size inside the media query. 
    5. By using * or :root I can target everything and make them apply to all. Whatever else I wrote for a specific tag it will only affect that selector.
